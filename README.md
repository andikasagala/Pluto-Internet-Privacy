Pluto Internet Privacy is a tool for internet privacy. It is free and open source, you can develop nor rewrite it into another programming languages also with your own logic thinking method. It is important to keep your internet privacy to avoid Internet Network Virus, Internet Network Spy, Cyber War, etc.<br><br><br>

<h3>Features:</h3><br>
- Available for many Unix distro<br>
- As a secure Proxy server and secure encrypted connection for many clients, also Science Laboratory. Ie: Linux, BSD, Windows, Android, etc<br>
- Public and Private servers routing for Privacy<br>
<br>
<br><br><br>

<h3>Private Server Specs: ( Coming soon... )</h3><br>
- Processor: Intel Xeon-D 2123IT - 4 c / 8 t - 2.2 GHz / 3 GHz https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/136429/intel-xeon-d-2123it-processor-8-25m-cache-2-20-ghz.html<br>
- Memory: From 32GB<br>
- Disk: NVMe<br>
- Server Location: Germany<br>
- No logs stored in server. Your logs will be stored in your own machine<br>
- Will be upgraded into higher server specs and more server locations soon<br>
 <br><br><br>

<h3>Main Purposes:</h3>
- Anyone are welcome ( unrestricted based on culture, religion, country, etc ) <br>
- Student and Scientist ( Coder, Hacker, Programmer, Security Tester, Physician, Mathematician, Chemist, etc ) <br>
- Any Laboratory experiments are welcome (ie: Networking, DDOS, Virus, Trojan, Software Dev, etc )<br> <br> <br>


<h3>Purposes:</h3><br>
- To keep your privacy while connected to the internet with strong encryption<br>
- To keep you safe from cyber war<br>
- Scientific <br>
<br><br><br>

<h3>Science Laboratory Concepts: </h3>
- Networking, DDOS, Virus, Trojan, Software Dev, etc for experiments <br>
- Clean your internet line using 'Pluto Internet Privacy' before connecting to Science Laboratory <br>
- Clean internet line will connect and remote the Science Laboratory <br>
- Not the part of war equiptment, just Science Laboratory <br>
- After you finish using Science Laboratory, all of your experiments will be deleted so the other users will using fresh and new Science Laboratory (P.S: do not forget to backup your experiment result before you leaving the Science Laboratory )<br><br><br><br>


<h3>Warnings:</h3><br>
- Do not use for Banking login, Private account login (twitter, facebook, instagram, etc ), etc. Use your default Internet Service Provider for it<br>
- Science purposes only <br>
- Install it in Unix Operating System<br><br><br>


<h3>How to use:</h3><br>
- Run " $git clone https://github.com/andikasagala/Pluto-Internet-Privacy " <br>
- Run in your terminal console " $sh install.sh " for the first time to install the " Pluto Internet Privacy " <br>
- Config stored in /var/log/earth.cfg and logs in /var/log/earth.log  <br>
- Run in your terminal console "$sh /usr/local/bin/EarthPlanet/GoToPluto" to start/activate it<br>
- There are 3 options: 1. Public Privacy Server, 2. Private Privacy Server, 3. Science Laboratory <br>
- Terminate/stop it by run in console " $sh /usr/local/bin/EarthPlanet/GoHome " for finish using "Pluto Internet Privacy"  <br>
- Terminate/stop it by run in console " $sh /usr/local/bin/EarthPlanet/Shutdown " for fresh start  <br>
